# 🐍 Python‑Progress

Welcome to **Python‑Progress** — a hands‑on repository focused on strengthening Python fundamentals, object‑oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and algorithmic problem‑solving through practical examples and challenges.

This project is designed for learners who want to **move beyond courses** and build real skills through practice.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

The repository includes:

### 📌 OOP Practice
Structured exercises focused on:
- Classes & Objects
- Methods & Attributes
- Problem modeling (e.g., BankAccount, Product Inventory)

### 📌 Data Structures
Implementation of core linear data structures:
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists

### 📌 Recursive Challenges
Practice problems that use recursion to build algorithmic thinking:
- Factorial sequences
- Fibonacci with memoization
- String reversal using recursion

### 📌 Algorithmic Problem Solving
Classic and practical exercises to level‑up algorithm skills:
- Two‑Sum Problem
- Valid parentheses using stack
- Find duplicates without built‑ins
